# AAT-matching-ARIADNE

This is a small script to prepare AAT matching json file for the AAT pipeline in the ARIADNE aggregator.

1) Fill the xlsx sheet after importing on Google Sheets or locally using Excel or Libre Office
2) Save as your data in CSV format
3) Update the filename in the Python script
4) Run the Python script
5) Upload the resulting file to the appropriate provider folder on the aggregator server

The matchings in the files were prepared by Ashely Green at the Swedish Data Service. Those matches are used on the ARIADNE portal for the Swedish Rock Art dataset.
